				<p class="IntroP">What is the South if it’s not an island? </p>
				
				<p>
				As someone born and grew up in south China, I experience how the south is isolated and connected. This might sound contradictory. The exhibition target to have an academic discussion about the art atmosphere in Canton---- South China. If not an island, what is the South? As someone grew up there, I see south China as archipelagos surrounded by a rich water system culturally, politically, and geographically. <br><br>

				I was inspired by the geography of the south, how the archipelagos are isolated but connected by each other. The Graphic design was made into motion graphics to have a better expression of the flowing big titles as if they are floating in the water. And the information was placed statically on the red archipelagos. The spatial design was created with Chun Hoi Hui, an architect. Which was constructed by the same concept of archipelagos, the red carpets on the floor were cut into the shapes of archipelagos. Artworks were placed on the red carpets--the archipelagos and the audience will visit one archipelago to another on the floor--the rivers.
