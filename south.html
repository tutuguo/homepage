			<h2 class="h2" style="width: 100%">Tutu designed a visual for the exhibition the South Is Not an Island in OCAT Shenzhen. The exhibition target to have an academic discussion about the art atmosphere in Canton---- south China. If not an island, what is the South? As someone grew up there, Tutu sees south China as archipelagos surrounded by a rich water system culturally, politically, and geographically. On the design, the big titles flow as if they are floating in the water which builds connections among the archipelagos. The design was displayed on the OCAT area and merchandised into ice creams and notebooks.Â </h2>
