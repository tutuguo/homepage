		<p class="P">If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style. —— Quentin Crisp </p>
		<p1 class="p1">
		Failure has been a long time linked to humiliation and embarrassment in people’s minds. When it happens, it seems to be the end of the story and no-one wants to continue the discussion about it. I started to question these situations and analyze what failure is. Failure contains logic and consequence, shows the way avoiding errors and provides an experience that can be applied in other different cases. 
			
		So based on my concept about failure, I designed an interactive device. The audience standing in front of the printer can scan an attached QR code and share their stories of failure on a webpage. And once they click 'submit', their stories will be transferred to the printer. In a few seconds, the printer will print out a 'Failure Award' on a glory paper with red and gold. On the paper, it states 'Congratulations that you are honored by the failure of xxx'

		Based on my observation, most of the audiance laughed after receiving their certification of failure. And some told me they would take home and hang it to encourage facing failure more optimistically. 

		For a long time, I am interested in the hidden message in inertial thinking. And I have experimented with it for a period as well. However, this is the most successful project along with them all.
