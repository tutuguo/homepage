		<p1 class="p1" style="width: 100%">Lost is More initiate users to experience a different way of using time.<br>Lost is more is a navigation app.<br>Yet unlike other navigation app, Less is more does not provide route.<br>It provides and seek extra meaning during the trip beyond destination.
		<br><br>With this design, I want to emphasise how much we rely on technology. But the goal is not to force people against navigation but to encourage people to enjoy the experience of getting lost, explore the environment and have awareness about the potential consequence technology can cause.<br><br><br>(Currently offline cuz the server is too expensive.)</p1>
