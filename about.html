	<h1 class="about">About Me</h1>	
		
	<h1 class="h">I like to use design to create interaction and communication with people, <br>to encourage people to look at issues from a totally different perspective, <br>to trigger people to stop, to take a break, to watch, and to think.<br>
I like to make things which can move, like short movies, motions, <br>or which can trigger people to move, like interaction devices.  

I am a designer/writer/curator/analogue photographer. <br>I am currently living in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. <br>I grew up in Guangzhou, a huge city in south China. <br>And I moved here for my bachelor's study when I was 18. </h1>
